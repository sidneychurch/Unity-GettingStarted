1. Go to https://unity.com/download

2. On this page you'll see links under their first step. 
   - You want to download the correct one depending on your operating system.

This will download the Unity Hub, which is an application where you can download various version of the engine and where you will create and launch your projects.

3. After Unity Hub finishes downloading, install the program. 
   - You can leave any options set to their default values.

## Open Unity Hub and Create an Account

    - You'll be greeted with a prompt to sign in. If you happen to have a Unity account that you want to use, feel free to sign in. 
    - Otherwise, click on the option to Create Account.

## Creating an Account
***

After clicking "Create Account", your web browser should open.

1. Fill out the form. 
    - You don't have to use your LSU email, but if you do, you can apply for the education version of Unity that gets you some discounts. 

> [!TIP]
> Also, I recommend only checking the first two options at the bottom. 
> If you agree to the third, you'll get spam.


2. Once complete, click on "Create Unity ID"

3. Once you have an ID, you can head back to the Hub and click on "sign in".
   - This will again open your browser and you may see a redirect link pop up like this:

### Select Modules

Next you have a list of modules that you can choose to install. You don't need all of them. We just want to make sure that we can publish games for Mac and Windows.

From the list:
* Uncheck - Microsoft Visual Community 2022
    - If you are familiar with this IDE and like it, feel free to keep it. 
    - We will be installing VSCode, which I find the UI to be cleaner, as our IDE later on.

* Check - Mac Build Support (Mono)
* Check - Universal Windows Platform Build Support

Then click on the "Install" button.

You should now see the progress of your install.

As Unity is installing, you can go ahead and start installing VSCode.
